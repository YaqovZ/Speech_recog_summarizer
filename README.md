# Speech_recog_summarizer
It is a little project to make use of the available libraries and APIs (vosk, HuggingFace) to create a simple English speech recognizing and summarizing algorithm, written in Python. It also makes use of shell command.
The project is still in progress. Currently, a program that can transcribe short audio files has been made, and further I shall enable it to transcribe longer audio and summarize the content.
